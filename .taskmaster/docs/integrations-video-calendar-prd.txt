# Video Conferencing & Calendar Integrations PRD
## PharmaDOC Platform Enhancement

### 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Objective:** Implement comprehensive video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet) and universal calendar integration (Google, Outlook, Apple CalDAV) for the PharmaDOC platform, enabling seamless virtual and hybrid appointment management between doctors and pharma representatives.

**Current Tech Stack:**

- Webhook handler system for real-time event processing
- Secure token management with encryption
- Graceful fallback mechanisms for provider outages
- Observable integration health monitoring

**Expandability Design:**
- Interface-based provider abstraction
- Configuration-driven provider management
- Hot-swappable provider implementations
